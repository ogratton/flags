# Flags

Pierre de Coubertin, designer of the Olympic Flag, said of it in 1912:

> ... the six colours [including the flag's white background] combined in this way reproduce the colours of every country without exception. The blue and yellow of Sweden, the blue and white of Greece, the tricolour flags of France, England [i.e. United Kingdom], the United States, Germany, Belgium, Italy and Hungary, and the yellow and red of Spain are included, as are the innovative flags of Brazil and Australia, and those of ancient Japan and modern China. This, truly, is an international emblem.

But six colours seems like an awful lot. What's the minimum set of colours that satisfies this property?
